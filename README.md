# Photon Framework

This is a community fork of the original Lumen framework by the Laravel team.

We miss it, and want to see more leveraging of APIs in PHP over full-stack frameworks only.

## Changes

- Stricter Type casting
- PHP 8.3 minimum version
- More modern PHP features adopted.

## Future plans

- Support for Laravel Octane
- Adopting Laravel Generators
